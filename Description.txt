				**    The Bouncing Balls   **
				*****************************

	Welcome to my Cannon Ball game; 
	Basically, this game is an application that simulates spheres (Bouncing Balls) moving through a frictionless 
	environment (4 cubes) with random gravity every 5-10 seconds.
	
	HOW DOES IT WORK:
	
    	At the beginning, the scene is created with the bouncing balls in the 4 cubes. Meanwhile, their positions are
	being recorded in a file named Ballspositions.txt. You can move around with the mouse see the scene in different
	angles. To exit, simply press the left button of the mouse.
	
	Note:
	To be able to see the recorded coordinates or positions of the balls, you have to exit the application by a
	simple left click of the mouse. If you exit with the escape key, nothing will be recorded.

	HOW TO EXECUTE THE JAR FILE:
	Use the following command on the prompt in the current directory where the jar file and lib folder are located:
	
	java -jar MyGame.jar
